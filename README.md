Collection of shell scripts that i made because i'm bored, with the goal to make scripts that are POSIX compliant but also useful for me

Scripts:

- `dropbox`: Simple dropbox uploader, also able to share file and print the url using `-s` flag.
- `template`: Simple template manager, create a template or copy a template to a destination
- `todo`: Simple todo list.
